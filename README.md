Paint with the mouse, or press [space] to sit back and enjoy the sceneries changing automagically. If you feel adventurous, you can also attempt to do both simultaneously.
## Controls:
* [mouse]: paint
* [H]: show help
* [enter]: generate a new scenery
* [space]: toggle animation of scenery
* [B]: toggle bright mode
* [D]: toggle dark mode
* [P]: toggle pretty mode (enabled by default)

:warning: If you resize the game window, generate a new scenery or toggle a mode, your current artwork will vanish.

The code does not use an internet connection, it is supposed to work locally.
### About this project
This is an attempt to familiarize myself with `<canvas/>`. I have some experience in programming but not much with JavaScript, so my code is far from optimal.
