Paint with the mouse, or press [space] to sit back and enjoy the sceneries changing automagically. If you feel adventurous, you can also attempt to do both simultaneously.
## Controls:
* [mouse]: paint
* [enter]: generate a new scenery
* [space]: play / pause

:warning: if you resize the game window, the game will be reloaded without your current artwork.

The code does not use an internet connection, it is supposed to work locally.
### About this project
