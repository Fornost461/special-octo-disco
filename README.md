### About this project
This is an attempt to familiarize myself with `<canvas/>`. I have some experience in programming but not much in JavaScript, so my code is far from optimal. The code does not use an internet connection, it works locally.

The license is [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), which means you should _not_ ask for my permission if you want to reuse these files, nor cite me as having authored them. Feel free to copy, improve and build better things from them!
